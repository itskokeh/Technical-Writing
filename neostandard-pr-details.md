# NeoStandard PR

This PR improves the documentation by:

1. Adding examples for all configuration options to make it easier for users to
   understand and use NeoStandard.
2. Including a note on converting ESM examples to CJS for users who prefer
   CommonJS.
3. Adding a base example to show the overall structure of a NeoStandard
   configuration.

## Changes
- Added examples for `env`, `files`, `filesTs`, `globals`, `ignores`, `noJsx`,
`noStyle`, `semi`, and `ts`.
- Added a note explaining how to convert ESM examples to CJS.
- Added a base example at the top of the Configuration Options section.

## Why These Changes Are Helpful

- Beginner-Friendly: Clear examples reduce the learning curve.
- Flexibility: The CJS note accommodates users who prefer CommonJS.
- Reference: The base example provides a quick starting point for users.
